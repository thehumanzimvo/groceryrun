### What
Want to do grocery shopping for the month or small snacks, but you are just too lazy to go to the store sites, or worse - go to each the store, and look through what each store has? I got you BRO!!!

<b>groceryRun</b> to the rescue! :D. You tell it what you want from which store and it get's the grocery list with prices and any special offers happening to your email or your pc. Hey! You're welcome :D
### Setup
This is a console scrapper, no GUI/user interface yet. To use the code you will need to install:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) environment.
- an <b>IDE</b> that runs python. I would recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but if you already have PyCharm then go with that, or what ever you prefer.
- <b>Libraries</b> include [Beautiful Soup(bs4)](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/), [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/). the rest should come with Python
- If you want to use the email feature, you will have to enter in your own "sender" email before starting the programme. Here's a [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Bg9r_yLk7VY?t=479) on that.

If you are not familiar with Python, I would recommend this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTmJE4k0ho) or any free videos on Youtube, otherwise wait for the user friendly interface coming soon.
### Play
1. Once you run the program it will prompt you to select the store you want to shop from, select the corresponding number
2. Then it will ask for a "grocery list", type in 1 item name then press enter to add it to the list, then type another e.g. "Grapes"[enter], "Grape Juice"[enter]. Type in "Done" then press enter to finish your grocery list.
Use "poop2.py" for this.
3. The it will ask you if you want to send the list to an email address or create a spreadsheet on your pc to store the list.
4. Above action will be executed and you have your grocery list
### Coming Soon
- User friendly clickable interface
- list Filter for giving you only what you asked for e.g. If you type something like "grape" it will return grape juice along with all other items with grape in the name - I want to remove this.
- <b>Budget</b>: you can enter your budget and the returned list will show you what's in your budget and the total sum of all the grocery list.
- <b>Price beat</b>: Compare prices between stores for your grocery list.
### Caviets
- Unfortunately I can't request from more than 1 store at the moment, the request fails and I am working on it.
- If you type something like "grape" it will return grape juice along with all other items with grape in the name
